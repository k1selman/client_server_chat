# Simple Client/Server chat type application

**Libraries used:** stdio.h, stdlib.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h

**Idea:** Simple application that allows users to send text messages to each other.

**Goal:** Learn how sending/receiving messages through the server works by programming it.

**TODO:** Make a GUI, make sure to fix all the bugs (if there are any)
