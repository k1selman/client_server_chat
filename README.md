# Simple Client/Server chat type application

**Libraries used:** stdio.h, stdlib.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h

**Idea:** Simple application that allows users to send text messages to each other.

**Goal:** Learn how sending/receiving data through the server works by programming it.

**In order to run it one will have to: **

**1.** Compile server and client side source code

**2.** Run the server exec and client exec

**3.** Once you have done this, you can start sending messages from the client side.

**TODO:** Make a GUI, make sure to fix all the bugs (if there are any)
